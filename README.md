## About 

Interval Timer was inspired when exercising at the gym with my friend using an interval timer. I was complaining about adds and features that I wanted. My friend said "why don't you just make one?". Now it's on the Play Store for free.

## Features
- Store user-created timers
- An active timer session will restore application state when foregrounded if accidentally backgrounded
- Configurable; choose whether or not to have rest or ready rounds
- Vibration and sound options to signify round changes, near-end of rounds, and when it's completed
- Set the duration of each round using a picker, onPressIn, or onPress buttons
- Material Dark Theme
