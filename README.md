## About 


Interval Timer was inspired when I was using a popular interval timer when exercising in the gym. There was some features that I wish it had. Now, I am developing one for myself that will implement the features I want from an interval timer. Then, I will share it with others for free on the app store.

In order to create a high quality mobile application, the application: 
- must be robust
- must be well-documented
- must include a test suite
- must work on various devices
- must be user friendly, intuitive, and attractive ( a good design )
- must be maintained

## Features
- Store user-created timers to easily use for later
- When a timer is started and the app is minimized/backgrounded, the timer is restored to the current time when the app is active again
- Choose whether or not to use ready or rest rounds
- Vibration and sound to signify round changes
- Set the duration of each round using a picker, onPressIn, or onPress
