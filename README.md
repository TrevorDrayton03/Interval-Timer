## About 

Interval Timer was inspired when exercising at the gym with my friend using an interval timer. I was complaining about adds and features that I wanted. My friend said "why don't you just make one?". Now it's on the play store for free for anyone else who wants to use it.

## Features
- Store user-created timers to easily use for later
- An active timer session will restore state to the proper duration and round when foregrounded if accidentally backgrounded.
- Configurable; choose whether or not to have rest or ready rounds.
- Vibration and sounds to signify round changes, near-end of rounds, and when it's over.
- Set the duration of each round using a picker, onPressIn, or onPress
- Material Dark Theme
